Simple Typing Speed Test -- Alan Zhong

This program tests how fast your typing speed is using an average of 5 tests, each of which
generates a random sequence of words and times how long you take to type them. The program then 
outputs several statistics such as accuracy, wpm, and consistency among tests.

Note: make sure to download dict.txt as well and include it in the same folder as the program!
